# Print date

Print date is a kata developed by [Codium](https://www.codium.team) to teach [Test doubles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_double) during the [Working with Legacy code training](https://www.codium.team/curso-legacy-code.html)

The idea is very simple, how to test a method that prints the current date.

# Technical details
All the repositories have a Makefile to simplify the setup of the kata.

The katas can be run with or without docker.
